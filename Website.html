<h1> Welcome to my profile </h1>


<h2> Personal Information </h2>
	<p>My name is Michael Ly (pronounced as Lee), my student number is s3899226 and my school email is s3899226@student.rmit.edu.au, I am a first-year student at RMIT, so there is a lot of things that are new to me. I want to learn everything there is to learn about IT because technology has been growing drastically over the past few years. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia in 2012, legally. My main language that I speak is English, but I can also speak Vietnamese fluently.

I like to make music but recently I got interested in investing in cryptocurrency, but I also try to explore new things. I never thought that I would go to university and study IT, back in year 11 and start of year 12, I was dead set on becoming a music producer and would study music, but here I am.

My favourite animal is dogs, but my dad won’t let me have I pet, I believe if I had a dog, I would be 10 times happier than how I am right now. My ultimate goal in life is to get rich, move out of my parents’ house and get a dog. 

My favourite thing to watch is anime, it’s an easy way to forget about reality for a while… I know it sounds sad.

I also like working out and try my best to be consistent.

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p> In the modern world, technology is everywhere, if you ask a Generation Z today if they would rather live one day without food or technology, they would choose to live the day without food. The first thing a person look at or touch in the morning is likely to be their phone or technology. This is exactly why I want to learn more about it.</p>

<h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
<p>I am interested in learning programing code and learn software development. I am not familiar with programming language, but I just learned a little bit about it and it was really interesting learning different codes.</p>

<h3> When did the interest start?</h3>
<p>My interest in IT started last year, when I got my PC, I would binge YouTube to learn about what each specific part of my PC component does. I would learn about building PCs, learning what a core does, motherboard does, what ram does… and that was when my interest in IT started.</p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, my interest in IT started when I got my PC, but the person that kept my interest going was the YouTube channel ‘Linus Tech Tips’.</p>

<h3>Why did I choose to come the RMIT?</h3>
<p>The main reason I joined is because of influence by my parents. But also RMIT is one of the top university in my opinion, to learn about technology, in my opinion.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p>I was expecting to learn about web developing, app developing, programming language. Expecting to learn about software and hardware.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>Studying IT can lead to a variety of careers choices because it is really diverse. It can vary from, technical writer, web developer, information technology director, chief technology officer and so much more. In the IT industry there is potential for earning good money. Not only that, as the technology progresses, the need for information technology professionals will only increase.</p>

<p>My ideal job in IT is being a programmer. </p>
<p>This is a job for new graduates: </p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51785909?type=standard#searchRequestToken=19243257-6499-44bb-8e5b-98bd7b99dd4b">Job Link</a>

<p>A skill required for this job is to have a degree in Computer Science or equivalent. Basic programming experience, knowledge of databases and operating systems.</p>
<p>Computer programmers work closely with web and software developers to write code for new mobile applications or computer programs. Computer programmers have strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and enjoy using logic to solve complex problems which is one of the reason why I find it intriguing as I’m very good at mathematics and enjoy problems solving.</p>
<p>To be qualified to be a programmer, a person is required to have completed a qualification in computer science with a focus on software development. This could be a Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming). </p>
<p>Currently I barely have any experience in programming as I did no do IT in VCE. But I will try to learn as much as I can from the resources of RMIT as well as learning from online or from teachers and friends.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>What am I passionate about?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, I am into cryptocurrencies, not only crypto but I am also interested in making as much money as possible in crypto. Which is why I my project idea is a cryptocurrency trading bot.</p>

<h3>What kind of skill can I develop from this project?</h3>
<p>I would be able to learn how to code and be better at programming language which can help me with my course, and not only it can benefit me with my course but also benefit me with my passion if my project is developed properly.</p>

<h3>What is cryptocurrency?</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that works as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. People either uses as a type of financial transaction or invest their money in it and wait until the value of the currency to go up and take profit.</p>

<h3>What is the purpose of a cryptocurrency trading bot?</h3>
<p>A purpose of a trading bot is to minimise money loss and maximise profit, it does this by buying and selling the crypto currencies at the correct time, the bot trades cryptocurrencies on the behalf of users. The bot can enable the user to manage all crypto exchange account in one place.</p>

<h3>What is the motivation for this project?</h3>
<p>As mentioned, a trading bot minimise money loss and maximise profit, which leads the the motivation for this project. I would want me and others who are interested to make as much money as possible from crypto but not everyone has time of day to trade and even if they do, they may not make the trade at the correct time to maximise profit. So, by developing this project, this could help me as well as other people achieve this goal. The bot is there so that the user does not need to do anything, and the program will do everything, even when the user is sleeping.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Crypto trading bots are designed to trade cryptocurrency assets on the user’s behalf. Without the bot, the user would typically have to sit in front of their device and pick which cryptocurrency to buy and sell. The problem with that is that there is a high risk of losing as it is a gamble to just pick a coin and buy.</p>
<p>The bot would gather market data, interpret it, calculate the potential risk, and execute the action (buy or sell). The crypto trading bot follows one rule, buy low and sell high, meaning when a price of a coin goes down, the bot would buy the coin using a small percentage of the money in your balance, and would continue to buy if the price keeps going down. Same goes when the price goes up, the bot would start selling a small amount to make sure you have profits and continue to sell if the price keeps going up.</p>
<p>A key component in crypto trading bots have is market data analysis, this module of the bot will save raw market data from different sources which will help it decide whether to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency. It also uses the market data to calculate the potential risk in the market. Based on the information, the bot will decide how much to invest or trade. If the bot interprets the data that the trade has a high risk for potential downside, it will only invest a little. If the bot interprets the data as low risk and high potential for big profit, the bot will invest more. Sometimes it’s not a good idea to buy a token in bulk but in some situations call for immediate purchases. The bot will help the user decide that.</p>
<p>By using a trading cryptocurrency bot, this can eliminate delays and human error, if a bot is receiving the correct data and has suitable algorithms, it can trade crypto with a higher chance of profit.</p>
<p>If you have done crypto trading before you will know that your emotions will be all over the place, by using the bot, the user will not have to worry about having stress as the trading bot takes every single decision based on data. Although experienced traders may overpower their emotions and make rational decisions, but that may not be the case with beginners.</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of benefits to having a crypto trading bot, there are also downside. First one of the downsides is that this is cryptocurrency, and it is a form of gambling and can also have extreme unpredictable outcome. Situations like this can happen, for example, the start of the corona virus pandemic, impacted the crypto market heavily and caused it to plummet. Situations like this, it is better to trust your instincts than using a trading bot. </p>
<p>The benefits of having a trading bot can only be achieved if the programming is done correctly, having programming errors can impact the efficiency of the bot.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>To make a crypto trading bot, a computer is required. There are many programs that can be used to make a trading bot. A person can make it from scratch or use a platform that allows a person to customise the bot. A few examples are, Hummingbot, Trality. Hummingbot is an open-source command-line interface that lets the user build their own automated trading bot. Similarly to Hummingbot, Trality provides a graphical UI for a user to build their bot.</p>

<h3>What are the skills required?</h3>
<p>To be able to build your own trading bot, a person would need to be familiar with programming languages. The person would also need to be familiar with cryptocurrencies and their exchanges. Currently, binance.com is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<h3>Outcome </h3>
<p>If the project is successful, this can help a person make passive income from cryptocurrency, it may be able to take off the stress from traders as it will only make decisions based on data and not emotions. It can save a lot of time for traders and minimise loss and maximise profits for users.</p>
